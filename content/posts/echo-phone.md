Thisâ€‹ interactive artwork explores call and response and imitation of rhythms in a virtual world, with gesture guided chance.

The echo phone senses button presses from the user, interprets them as a rhythm and stores it in memory. It remembers up to 16 rhythms, which can be recalled by the user. To do this, the user has to make a swipe gesture over the ultrasonic sensor, which will set off a randomised carousel-like picker that travels through the different memory locations. The distance of the swipe is mapped to the time it will take to choose a new rhythm (closer is longer, and vice-versa).

### Forms of echoes:

* The ultrasonic sensor uses echoes to measure distance
* The device remembers and recalls rhythms
* The piezo vibrates the spring inside the _phone_, causing the tin to resonate
