This is the website I made for my final degree show, "So, How is _That_ Working For You?" (5-8 Sept 2019).
Map implemented by Julia Makivic.

Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site generator, HTML/CSS3 and JavaScript (no libraries). Makes use of a monospace font and the "ch" unit in CSS to perfectly align the ASCII art design to the grid.
