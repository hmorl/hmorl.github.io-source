A sonification of John Conway’s [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), the famous cellular automaton. Built in Ableton’s Max for Live, the system treats an iterating 2D grid as a generative arpeggiator, which outputs MIDI to a synth. Each cell of the grid can be alive or dead, the state of which is determined by a simple set of rules based on the number of neighbours it has.

Visuals coded in [Processing](https://www.processing.org).

I made this as part of my Digital Improvisation module at University of Surrey, and it was selected to win the Ableton Prize for best live computer-based musical performance.
