A sonification of the [Lorenz Attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system), a chaotic system made up of 3 differential equations. Programmed in Max/MSP + Jitter, the system derives melodic content from the x, y and z values of 2 simultaneously running Lorenz systems, as well as the distance between them, illustrating the [butterfly effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).
